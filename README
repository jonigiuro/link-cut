My first Ruby on Rails app, so it might be a bit of a mess.

Gems used:
- devise (for users registration-authentication)
- nokogiri (for parsing the title of the website which is being saved)

To make this work you need to create a bookmarklet which has this as an address: javascript:var%20e=document.createElement('script');e.setAttribute('language','javascript');e.setAttribute('src','http://evening-beach-7146.heroku.com/i/'+encodeURIComponent(location.href));document.body.appendChild(e);void(0);

---OR---

You can visit http://evening-beach-7146.heroku.com/ and drag it from the homepage to your toolbar.

How this works:
- User visit a page on the internets and clicks on bookmarklet.
- server receives request and sends it to an action in the controller
- the controller uses a view.js.erb to create a div on top of what the user is currently seeing.

Off course there's some user authentication in the middle, but that's the basic functionality.

It uses some ajax to remove the links from the list and refresh the view.

--------EDIT--------

Ajax removed for now.
BUT I added Projects.
Let's say you're working on a new javascript project, you can create a project called "Javascript" and add all the javascript related links to it. In this way you can keep your links organized.
